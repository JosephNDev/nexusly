2025-06-26T12:07:24.895Z  - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
2025-06-26T12:07:24.896Z  - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
2025-06-26T12:07:24.896Z  - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
